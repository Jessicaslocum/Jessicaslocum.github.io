			<article><p>Do you ever find yourself asking "Are there any questions?" or "Does that make sense?" to a room of blank faces? By asking open-ended, content-specific questions you will develop a better understanding of your students' knowledge.<br><br>
				Checks for understanding are simple, non-graded, in-class activities designed to give you and your students useful feedback on the teaching-learning process. Checking for understanding offers an opportunity to uncover misunderstandings together so gaps in learning can be addressed before leaving class.</p></article>
				<article><p>Effective checking for understanding requires making many decisions behind the scenes in order to gather data and take action. What do you want to know from students? What question will you craft to discern the extent and root of student misunderstanding? How is it aligned with your learning objectives? Which method matches the rigor of your question that will garner responses from every student or a strategic sample of your students? How are you collecting this data? Does your data reveal student confusion? If necessary, how will you reteach in a different way before moving on and identify which students need further assistance?</p></article>

				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>1-2 Pairs</h3>
					<img src="images/onetwopairs.png" alt="Think-Pair-Share" height=140px width=100%>
					<p>Prompt: “Raise two fingers if you understand the material well. Raise one finger if you understand this material okay.”  Then pair sets of 1’s and 2’s. You may ask the 2's to re-explain the information to 1’s, work on the next exercise together, or pair program together.</p>

				<article>
					<h3>Give Me Five</h3>
					<img src="images/handsraised.png" alt="Fist to Five" height=140px width=100%>

					<h3>Misconception Check</h3>
					<img src="images/misconceptions.jpg" alt="..." height=140px width=100%>
					<p>Present students with common or predictable misconceptions about a designated concept, principle, or process. Ask them whether they agree or disagree and explain why. The misconception check can also be presented in the form of a multiple-choice or true-false quiz.</p>
				</article>
				<article>
					<h3>Study Guide</h3>
					<img src="images/studyguide.png" alt="Study Guide" height=140px width=100%>

	<h2 id="followingup">Following Up with Data</h2>
	<div class="paragraph flexbox">
		<div class="explanatorytext">
			<p>Effective checking for understanding means gathering data constantly and acting on it immediately. The second part is often harder to do, but just as important.</p>
		</div>
		<article><p>Gathering Data Strategy: Tracking, Not Watching.  Once you have a plan in place for what students need to accomplish, the next step is being intentional about how you observe and check students’ work and gather data to know whether students “got it.”  Rather than scanning to monitor behavior, you are scanning to fix misconceptions in the moment! There are two pieces to Tracking, Not Watching.</p></article>
		<article><p>Decide what you want to focus on. What do I want to ensure that 100% of students understand during this next chunk of time? Track these questions specifically and ignore other items or distractions.</p></article>
	</div>
	<img src="images/cfu-comic.png" alt="CFU Comic">
	<div class="explanatorytext"><p>mmmmmm</p></div>

	<p>Methods for Gathering Data:</p>
	<p>1. Via Questioning</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Reject Self-Report: The answer to “everybody got it?” is always yes and almost never accurate.</li>
		<li>Targeted Questioning: Ask questions to assess mastery after key steps in your lesson plan</li>
		<li>Strategic Sample Using Cold Call: Ask your targeted questions of students across the spectrum of likely skill</li>
		<li>Test for Reliability: Ask follow-up “why” and “how” questions to make sure the positive result is replicable</li>
		<li>Plan for Validity: Align to the rigor and format of what your students will ultimately be accountable for</li>
	</ul>
	<p>2. Via Observation</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Standardize the Format: Specify where students should write, what should be in the margin and where</li>
		<li>Tracking, Not Looking: Look for number and type of errors, tracking them so you can refer back to these data</li>
		<li>Show Me: “Slates”; Hand Signals</li>
		<li>Affirmative Checking: Establish ‘check points’ where students obtain approval for moving on</li>
	</ul>

	<!-- Fixing Misconceptions Strategy: Act on the Data. You saw glimpses of this in the strategies above. Acting on the data means having those quick individual conferences where you immediately intervene and have students explain their thinking.  This can also be done whole class if you see a common error that everyone is making and it is something that you need to address.  I think the most difficult piece of acting on the data, whether or not it is individual or whole group, is to focus on student thinking rather than simply on the student output.  Consider how you can ask questions that get students to explain their thought process and reasoning strategies so you can work with students to fix their misconception rather than simply pointing out that the answer is wrong and giving the correct “step” or solution.  Cathy Seely discusses the importance of teaching to “Get It” in her book Smarter Than We Think. She states ‘Getting it doesn’t happen by telling students facts and showing them a list of procedures….Getting it happens when students engage their minds in mathematical activity and connect what they are learning to what they already know or to emerging structures in their minds.”
