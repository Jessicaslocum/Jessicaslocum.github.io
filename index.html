			<p>The instructional rubric is an internally developed tool used with all General Assembly instructors globally to help our instructors assess their teaching skill level and set specific goals for each cohort. This rubric can be used by an instructional leader conducting an observation or by you, the instructor, as a tool for self-assessment. Review this site for a deeper dive of each section to evaluate possible strategies to consider.</p>

							<td>Learning Objectives</td>
							<td>Instructor may verbalize the learning objectives and agenda for the day. Neither are written and visible to students during the class.</td>
							<td>Instructor verbalizes learning objectives for the day, and they may be written or visible to students during the class. While there is always a written agenda, learning objectives are referenced inconsistently throughout the lesson.</td>
							<td>Instructor verbalizes learning objectives for the day. Agenda and objectives are always made visible in the same place in the room. He or she sometimes references learning objectives during the lesson.</td>
							<td>Instructor verbalizes learning objectives and agenda. Agenda and objectives are always made visible to students in the same place in the room. Learning objectives are consistently referenced throughout the lesson so students are able to clearly see how concepts and/or activities connect to learning goals. Instructor checks off learning objectives as they are achieved by students.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Making Connections</td>
							<td>Instructor makes no attempt to connect the lesson to prior learning or reference what students should expect to learn in the future.</td>
							<td>Instructor attempts to connect the lesson to prior learning but does so in a confusing manner and/or briefly mentions it in passing. Instructor inconsistently references what students should expect to learn in the future and why this knowledge is important.</td>
							<td>Instructor connects the lesson to prior learning but does not ask students to make a connection themselves. Instructor sometimes references what students should expect to learn in the future and why this content is important.</td>
							<td>Instructor inspires students to clearly make connections to prior learning. Instructor builds off these connections, referencing what the students will learn in the future and making the content's significance clear. Embedded in lesson are connections not only to the prior and upcoming material but also the big picture of the course and industry and/or careers for which it prepares its students.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Learning Objectives</td>
							<td>Opening framing is not present.</td>
							<td>Opening framing is present, although it ineffectively bridges into new content by missing a key component, such as making previous connections, discussing importance, or building anticipation.</td>
							<td>Opening framing is present and effectively bridges into new content by making previous connections, discussing importance, and building anticipation.</td>
							<td>Opening framing is present and effectively bridges into new content by using a hook that pulls from student or instructor experience to create a strong connection to the lesson. Opening framing serves as a thread that lives throughout the entire lesson.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Closing Framing</td>
							<td>Closing framing is not present.</td>
							<td>Closing framing is present, although it ineffectively closes the lesson by missing a key component, such as clarifying expectations of student learning, reiterating the 'why,' or linking to future lessons.</td>
							<td>Closing framing is present, and effectively closes the lesson by clarifying expectations of student learning, reiterating the 'why,' and linking to future lessons.</td>
							<td>Closing framing is present and effectively closes the lesson. Students lead most of the lesson recap with instructor guidance. Framing provides expectations for the upcoming assignment and what defines student success.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th rowspan="5"><a href="instruction.html">Instruction</a></th>
							<td>Explanation of Material</td>
							<td>Instructor explanations are ineffective or inefficient and lead to student confusion, impeding the learning progress. Instructor makes no attempt to clarify abstract concepts for students.</td>
							<td>Instructor explanations of key content and concepts are not effective or efficient, leading to moderate student confusion, slowing the pace of student comprehension, or decreasing student engagement with lesson content.</td>
							<td>Instructor explanations of key content and concepts are generally clear, but might not be as effective or efficient as possible. This may create a minor point of student confusion, a slightly slower pace of student comprehension, or a minor decrease in student engagement with lesson content.</td>
							<td>Instructor consistently, clearly, and accurately explains content and concepts, demonstrating strong knowledge of material. Abstract concepts are made concrete through explanation, examples, or projects students can easily grasp. Material increases student engagement in lesson content and comprehension. Instructor uses varies methods to explain content, such as drawing on numerous examples or engaging students in dialogue.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Scaffolded Instruction</td>
							<td>Instructor does not effectively implement declining scaffolding while planning and executing his or her lesson.</td>
							<td>Instructor provides the same level of scaffolding throughout the entire lesson. The level of scaffolding is random and does not gradually release student into independence. Instructor is not able to proactively address students and instead must reactively respond to questions because of this lack of gradual release.</td>
							<td>Instructor reduces scaffolding, but it is not based on the understanding students demonstrate. The reduction in scaffolding is effective for some students.</td>
							<td>Instructor leads students throughout the lesson, reducing scaffolding and/or guidance based on data collected from checks for understanding. The reduction in scaffolding is effective for most students. Instructor moves through new material, guided instruction, and independent practice. By the end of a lesson, students wil have the opportunity to practice what they have learned. </td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Abstract to Concrete</td>
							<td>Instructor does not attempt to make abstract concepts concrete for students.</td>
							<td>Instructor attempts to make abstract concepts concrete through explanation or lesson activities (i.e., metaphors, case studies), but the link is unclear and causes student confusion.</td>
							<td>Instructor makes abstract concepts concrete through explanation and/or lesson activities (i.e., metaphors, case studies), but the link could be clearer.</td>
							<td>Instructor effectively makes abstract concepts concrete through explanation and/or lesson activities (i.e., metaphors, case studies), and the link is clear.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Visuals</td>
							<td>Visual anchors (ex: images, whiteboarding) are not present where they would enhance student learning.</td>
							<td>Where appropriate, the lesson refers to a visual anchor, but it is not effective in capturing the key concepts of the lesson. The anchor may be disorganized, represented in a confusing way, or created without forethought of purpose.</td>
							<td>When appropriate, the lesson refers to a purposeful visual anchor illustrating key concepts. The instructor could more consistently and effectively offer varied visual/multimedia aids to increase impact and applicability of lesson. </td>
							<td>Instructor consistently uses a wide range of visual/multimedia aids to effectively bring the lesson and its key concepts to life. Instructor creates and uses visuals to draw connections, visualize complex ideas, and show how concepts are applicable in professional practice. Whether this visual was prepared in advance (e.g., slides or videos) or in class (e.g., whiteboarding), the instructor has a clear vision for the purpose it will serve in encouraging student understanding and engagement.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Directions/ Expectation Setting</td>
							<td>Directions for assignments are not clearly explained or visible. Students may appear visibly confused about directions for the assignment, and the instructor does not check for understanding.</td>
							<td>Directions for assignments are clearly explained but are not always visible during and/or after the verbal explanation. Instructor attempts to check for understanding by asking 'Are there any questions?'.</td>
							<td>Directions for assignments are clearly explained and the directions are always visible during and/or after the verbal explanation. Instructor verifies student understanding by asking for a summary.</td>
							<td>Directions for assignments are clearly explained and the directions are always visible throughout work time. Instructor verifies student understanding, and students are given a timer to self-pace during activity time.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th rowspan="3"><a href="cfu.html">Checking for Understanding</a></th>
							<td>Prompt & Frequency</td>
							<td>CFUs do not clearly link to learning objectives. Questions do not gather useful data to discern level of student understanding. CFUs rarely occur, if ever.</td>
							<td>Some CFUs are linked to learning objectives. Instructor crafts questions that would reliably discern whether or not students understand lesson material. CFUs occur 1-2 times per lesson.</td>
							<td>Majority of CFUs link to learning objectives. Instructor crafts questions that would reliably discern the extent of student understanding (e.g., scaffolded questioning). CFU number matches the number of learning objectives in the lesson.</td>
							<td>CFUs always link to learning objectives. Instructor crafts questions that would reliably discern the extent and root of student misunderstanding. CFU number matches the number of learning objectives in the lesson and addresses multiple levels of student comprehension (Depths of Knowledge).</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>CFU Method Execution</td>
							<td>CFU methods do not require a response from every student (i.e., "Are there any questions?", "Does that make sense?"). Instructor does not collect data about student understanding.</td>
							<td>CFU methods garner responses from students but are not comprehensive or strategic and may not illustrate specific areas of confusion (ie, Fist to Five or 'Raise your hand if...'). Data collected does not accurately measure the the class' overall understanding of the content.</td>
							<td>CFU uses variety of methods to garner response from a strategic sample of students in the room and illustrate areas of confusion (i.e., Think-Pair-Share, Targeted Questions). The methods used allow the instructor to passively collect data on the class' overall understanding of the content.</td>
							<td>CFU uses a variety of methods to garner responses from every student and illustrate areas of confusion (i.e., Gestures, White Desks). The method used matches the rigor of the learning objectives. Data collected strategically targets specific areas of student understanding and enables the instructor to specifically identify which parts of the lesson need to be reviewed.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Following Up with Data</td>
							<td>Instructor does not visibly respond to data students provide in order to clarify any misunderstandings.</td>
							<td>When data collection reveals student miscomprehension, the instructor answers questions but does not ensure students now understand material. Instructor's responses are sometimes relevant, effective, and efficiently executed.</td>
							<td>When data collection reveals student miscomprehension, the instructor spends time reteaching material in a different way before moving on. Instructor's responses to this confusion are usually relevant, effective, and efficiently executed.</td>
							<td>When data collection reveals student miscomprehension, the instructor will reteach in a different way before moving on and identify which students need further assistance. Instructor's responses to this confusion are always relevant, effective, and efficiently executed.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th rowspan="3"><a href="activelearning.html">Active Learning</a></th>
							<td>Active Learning</td>
							<td>Lesson is primarily lecture-based. Instructor provides limited opportunities for guided or individual practice, which then only occur at the end of class. The session has a ≥90:10 passive:active ratio.</td>
							<td>Lesson has both instruction and practice opportunities but most time is spent on passive learning. Opportunities for guided or individual practice may be missing. The session has an 80:20 passive:active ratio.</td>
							<td>Lesson has both instruction and practice opportunities, pausing every 15-20 minutes for student practice or CFU. Throughout the lecture, each student actively engages with the material at least once (i.e., discussing, explaining, problem-solving). Opportunities for guided and individual practice are present. The session has a 70:30 passive:active ratio.</td>
							<td>Instructor moves dynamically and fluidly between instruction and practice opportunities that are rigorous, conceptual, and skill-based, pausing every 10-15 minutes for student practice or CFU. During lecture, each student actively engages with the material multiple times, alone and/or with others. Opportunities for guided and individual practice are present. The session has a 60:40 passive:active ratio.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Pacing</td>
							<td>Instructor spends too much or too little time on one part of the lesson, resulting in concerns that students will acheive all learning objectives. Time allocated to different parts of the lesson appears unplanned or planned without purpose. Lesson may not end on time or may be incomplete.	Instructor inconsistently but purposefully allocates time to each part of a lesson.</td>
							<td>Instructor 'works the clock' but could do so more effectively or consistently (e.g., by checking for understanding) to know when to linger or move on.</td>
							<td>Instructor usually allots the appropriate amount of time to each part of the lesson, while flexibly making adjustments when necessary based on in-the-moment circumstances. Instructor effectively and consistently “works the clock” to increase urgency and maximize pacing.</td>
							<td>Instructor consistently maximizes the time devoted to each component of the lesson, while strategically making adjustments with ease when necessary based on in-the-moment student feedback and questions. Instructor effectively “works the clock” to increase urgency and maximize pacing.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>Student Engagement</td>
							<td>More than 50% of the students are visibly disengaged (i.e., students are texting or on social media) at some point during the class. Instructor does not address this disengagement by switching mode of delivery and continues with same form of instruction (e.g., lecture without checks for understanding).</td>
							<td>10-50% of the class is visibly disengaged (i.e., students are texting or on social media) at some point during the class. Instructor inconsistently attempts to address disengaged students or create a safe, respectful learning environment.</td>
							<td>Instructor, through checks for understanding and hands-on instruction, keeps 90% of students focused on the lesson and showing respect for the instructor and fellow students. Instructor uses engagement techniques (i.e., moving around the classroom, turn and talk, graphic organizers) to make class dynamic and intellectually rigorous. More than half the class is actively contributing.</td>
							<td>Instructor creates an environment of respect and rapport. Instructor quickly reengages students through dynamic, inquiry-driven lessons in which students are actively involved in answering and asking questions, as well as through hands-on activities. Instructor uses engagement techniques to keep entire class dynamic and intellectually rigorous.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th rowspan="2"><a href="classroomculture.html">Classroom Culture</a></th>
